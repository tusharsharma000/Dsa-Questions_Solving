Richest Customer Wealth - https://leetcode.com/problems/richest-customer-wealth/ - Easy

You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ customer has in the j​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.

A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

Input: accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
Output: 10
Explanation: 
1st customer has wealth = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 10 
3rd customer has wealth = 8
The 2nd customer is the richest with a wealth of 10.

Approach - keep one maxValue variable and keep on updating it after each out loop it will return us the max so far;

Code- 
var maximumWealth = function(accounts) {
    let maxSoFar = 0;
    for (let i=0;i< accounts.length;i++) {
        let sum = 0;
        for (let j=0;j<accounts[i].length;j++) {
            sum +=accounts[i][j];
        }
        maxSoFar = Math.max(sum,maxSoFar );
    }
    return maxSoFar;
};
